# 79NG Fjord Model
Code for a realistic numerical ocean model of the 79째 North Glacier (79NG) fjord in Northeast Greenland, using the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM, <https://getm.eu/>).

The model is based on the idealized setup by Reinert et al. (2023).
It is currently in an early development phase and not yet ready for any practical use.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

Developed by Markus Reinert at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnem체nde (IOW).
